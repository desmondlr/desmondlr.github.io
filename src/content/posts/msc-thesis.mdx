### Abstract:

Our sense of touch is foundational to our perception of the world. At the same time, it is the product of a plurality of sensory receptors and several physiological processes. A simplification of this multiplicity is reflected in two approaches to haptic simulation: vibrotactile and kinesthetic feedback. This thesis examines the potential of using a reduced dimension of touch to simulate physical interactions in virtual reality. We hypothesize that rendering only the vibrotactile component of an interaction will still produce a recognizable touch sensation, analogous to how one can recognize the subject of a black-and-white image despite the absence of complete visual information. This approach may not be suitable for all touch sensations, as some experiences might emphasize one perceptual mechanism or another. We explore an application that is well-suited for this approach: the simulation of sliders. Sliders are used in many settings; one example is audio equipment, where their tactility is of particular interest. We adapt an existing multi-modal haptic technique for simulating buttons to a vibrotactile-only technique for simulating sliders. As part of this, we compare the physical properties of these devices. To do so, we design, construct, and operate a probe for recording the force-displacement profile of sliders. We explore the efficacy of this simulation technique via a small-scale user study. We use a mixed-method approach to address two research questions: “Does this technique improve task performance for a selection task?” and “Does it produce a realistic sensation?” The results of the user study indicate a nuanced interplay of several effects but roughly suggest that the feedback does increase the perception of realism, although there is no notable improvement in performance for a simple selection task. A manual haptic device that engages every dimension of touch has yet to be created, through taking a reduced modality approach to rendering haptic interactions could allow rich experiences using existing hardware. This thesis explores the intricacies of following this approach by implementing a vibrotactile simulation of sliders in virtual reality.

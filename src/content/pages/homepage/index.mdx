Hi, I’m Desmond, a freshly minted graduate from a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Calgary. I am a curious and creative developer with a passion for building thoughtful, reliable software. I’m especially drawn to systems that bridge the digital and physical worlds, whether that’s through haptic simulation, geospatial tools, or infrastructure automation. I love tackling complex problems, learning new tools, and collaborating with others to turn big ideas into elegant, working systems.
